        <p> <strong>Creative Statement</strong> 
        <br> My work focuses both on the simple things in life and fully living it out. While I personally like a minimalist aesthetic with my works capturing a minimalist design through its quiet and mundane atmosphere, I also love working with bright colors and complicated techniques to fully highlight my works to its potential. The contrast between the mundane and the extraordinary, though polar-opposites, is something I love working with, because the principle of art remains the same—I can interchange what I know from either the minimal or maximal to better convey a story through my works. I am interested in improving my skill set through different art mediums to fully convey and emphasize the stories my work is trying to tell. </p>
